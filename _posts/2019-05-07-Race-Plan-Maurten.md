# Meal Plan for Challenge Roth

The plan will cover the days leading up to the race and the race day. The goal is to train low and race high (on carbohydrates). For that we need to know how much fat we oxidating per minute (g/minute). 1 gram of fat will give 9 kcal of energy. We will probably burn between 0.5 - 1.5 g/min, depending on the heartrate (the lower the better, the more fat will be oxidated). 

## 0.5g/min fat oxidation and 50g/h carbohydrates, weight 75kg
Based on 0.5 g/min I will oxidate 30 grams of fat an hour for a total energy of 270 kcal. With 50g of carbohydrates an hour I will have 200 kcal of energy for a total of 470 kcal. With a weight of 75kg I can run 470/75 = *6.2km/h*.

## 0.8g/min fat oxidation and 75g/h carbohydrates, weight 75kg
Based on 0.8g/min I will oxidate 48g/h fat for a total energy of 408 kcal. With 75g/h carbohydrates an I will have 300 kcal of energy  for a total of 708 kcal/h. I can run than 708/75 = *9.5km/h*

## 1.2g/min fat oxidation and 75/g carbohyrdates, weight 75kg
Based on 1.2g/min I will oxidate 72g/h fat for a total energy of 650 kcal. With 75g/h carbohydrates an I will have 300 kcal of energy  for a total of 950 kcal/h. I can run than 950/75 = *12.6km/h*

# What is a realistic running speed?
This is based on running efficiency/economy. How fast can I go with a low heartrate? Based on my on feeling my running efficiency is low. That is why I am training Maffetone style (hearrate below 135 bpm) for the bike and the run up to race day in Challenge Roth. The idea is to improve my effiency on the bike and the run. I try to bike 5-6 times a week and run 4-5 times a week for at least 1 hour each with on friday a longer day with swim (3800 meters) bike (3-5 hours) and run (2-3 hours).

The run speed is:

+------+-----+------+---------------------+
| DATE | BPM | KM/H |                     |
+------+-----+------+---------------------+
|      |     |      |                     |
|      |     |      |                     |
|      |     |      |                     |
|      |     |      |                     |
