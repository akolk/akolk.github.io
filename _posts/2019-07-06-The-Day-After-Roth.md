## Lessons learned (improvements)
Wetsuit too small?
Area position on bike
Sun protector apply
Camelbag during biking
Base HR too high
Increase number of carbs during 
HR for MAF training too high (was 135 and should be 125)


## Lessons learned (what went well)
electrolyes before and during race
high fat oxidation (probably) during race
Bullet coffee in the morning (coffe, mct oil, cream)
Breakfast (bullet coffee, scrambled eggs with bacon bits, oatmeal + milk + ucan) -> water next time
Running form/efficiency (run without making noise when the feet land)
The NOrth Face ultra running shoes (cushioning helped)
Train according to MAF (even though the MAF HR was 10 too high)
Increase PVC magnesium intake on daily basis (2 x 2 pills)
Friday training (basically half ironman)

## what to do for the next race?
test fat oxidation (grams)
bike fitting
power meter (garmin vector s3)
new tri-suit 
new wetsuit? (zone3 aspire?)
swim recovery (elbow high)












This plan will cover the days leading up to the race and the race day itself. The goal is to train low and race high (on carbohydrates). For that we need to know how much fat we oxidating per minute (g/minute). 1 gram of fat will give 9 kcal of energy. will probably burn between 0.5 - 1.5 g/minute, depending on the heartrate (the lower the better, the more fat will be oxidated). 

## 0.5g/min fat oxidation and 50g/h carbohydrates, weight 75kg
Based on 0.5 g/min I will oxidate 30 grams of fat an hour for a total energy of 270 kcal. With 50g of carbohydrates an hour I will have 200 kcal of energy for a total of 470 kcal. With a weight of 75kg I can run 470/75 = *7.2km/h*.

## 0.8g/min fat oxidation and 75g/h carbohydrates, weight 75kg
Based on 0.8g/min I will oxidate 48g/h fat for a total energy of 408 kcal. With 75g/h carbohydrates an I will have 300 kcal of energy  for a total of 708 kcal/h. I can run than 708/75 = *9.5km/h*

## 1.2g/min fat oxidation and 75/g carbohyrdates, weight 75kg
Based on 1.2g/min I will oxidate 72g/h fat for a total energy of 650 kcal. With 75g/h carbohydrates an I will have 300 kcal of energy  for a total of 950 kcal/h. I can run than 950/75 = *12.6km/h*

## Overview of different fat oxidation and carbo intake

The following formula can be used (for running): 
```
RunSpeed = (60F + 4C)/W 

F = fat oxidation in gram per minute
C = carbohydrate intake per hour in grams
W = Weight in Kilograms
```

The following formula can be used (for biking):
```
energy (kcal) = avg power (Watts) X duration (hours) X 3.6

of 

avg power(Watts) = energy(kcal) / (duration (hours) x 3.6)
```

# What is a realistic running speed?
This is based on running efficiency/economy. How fast can I go with a low heartrate? Based on my on feeling my running efficiency is low. That is why I am training Maffetone style (hearrate below 135 bpm) for the bike and the run up to race day in Challenge Roth. The idea is to improve my effiency on the bike and the run. I try to bike 5-6 times a week and run 4-5 times a week for at least 1 hour each with on friday a longer day with swim (3800 meters) bike (3-5 hours) and run (2-3 hours). This should also help to improve the fat oxidation.

The run speed is of the second KM in the run (MAF60, 1KM WU, 60min MAF, 1KM, CD):

| DATE | BPM | KM/H | PACE | kcal/hr |
|------|-----|------|------|---------|
|      |     |      |      |         |
|      |     |      |      |         |
|      |     |      |      |         |
|      |     |      |      |         |  

The swim speed and heart rate (DF #11 (3K)/DF #17 (3.5K)):

| DATE   |  AVG BPM  | MAX BPM | kcal |  Tempo/100  |
|:------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----:|:-----------:|
|  1/3   | 157       |   171   | 653  |  1:42       |
|  3/4   | 156       |   164   | 1148 |  1:42       |
| 19/4   | 159       |   171   | 812  |  1:47       |
| 29/5   | 146       |   157   | 640  |  1:43       |
| 31/5   | 134       |   142   | 489  |  1:45       | 

So run speed is roughly 6 minutes/km and the swim speed 1:45/km and the hearrate will be between 130-140bpm. Bikespeed is more difficult, but should be between 27-32KM/hrs.

| What     |  Pace   | AVG BPM |  Total   |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|Swim      |  1:45   |  135    | 1:06:00  |
| T1       |         |         | 0:08:00  |
| Bike     |  2:10   |  140    | 6:20:00  |
| T2       |         |         | 0:07:00  |
| Run      |  6:00   |  140    | 4:13:00  |
| Total    |         |         |11:54:00  |   


# Energy Distribution
Before the start of the race there will be 2000 kcal in the muscles and the liver. In the first hour there will be approx 800-1200 kcal burned by swmimming. This will take 70 minutes and will burn approx 70 grams of fat or 630 kcal. 470 kcal will come from carbs. The bike will take 6.5 hrs and 4550 kcals or 700 kcals/hour.

There are three things you need to manage on race day – hydration, electrolytes, and calories. In my experience, the order of importance has been, surprisingly: electrolytes, calories and fluid. In racing, if I’m well fuelled with calories and take in some electrolytes, my performance is better, even if – post exercise – I’m a bit short of fluids. This assumes you are adequately hydrated at the outset. The recommended dose has been only 400-600mg of sodium per hour – in my experience, that’s about half what most people seem to find success with. I’ve recommended 1,000mg of sodium (not salt, but sodium chloride) per hour and 750-1l of fluid per hour, though the fluid number seems to vary much more with the atmospheric temperature than the electrolytes. I take in the same amount of electrolytes on a cold day, but less fluid, and on a hot day I’ll take in more fluid.
I also often use salt capsules before a race and the day before the race for sodium
loading – taking on extra electrolytes in advance of competition.
