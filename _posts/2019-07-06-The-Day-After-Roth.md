## End Time prediction

The total time that I realised was pretty close to my predictions:

| What    | Predicted | Got      | Reason
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
|swim time| 01:05:00  | 01:12:46 | (1) (2)                   |
|T1 time  | 00:10:00  | 00:11:48 | (3)                       | 
|Bike time| 06:30:00  | 06:37:17 | (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)   |
|T2 time  | 00:10:00  | 00:08:44 | (10)                      |
|Run time | 04:15:00  | 04:05:11 | (5) (11)                  |
|Totaal   | 12:10:00  | 12:15:44 |                           |

## Lessons learned (improvements)
1. Wetsuit too small?
2. Panic attack/claustrofobic during first part of swim (may be because of 1)
3. Had toilet stop before biking 
4. Had toilet stops (3x) during biking
5. Sun protector apply
6. Camelbag during biking
7. Didn use the area position until the last 30KM or so (cost +/- +8%)
8. Base HR too high
9. Increase number of carbs during biking
10. Had a toilet stop before running
11. HR for MAF training too high (was 135 and should be 125)


## Lessons learned (what went well)
- electrolyes before and during race
- high fat oxidation (probably) during race
- Bullet coffee in the morning (coffe, mct oil, cream)
- Breakfast (bullet coffee, scrambled eggs with bacon bits, oatmeal + milk + ucan) -> water next time
- Running form/efficiency (run without making noise when the feet land)
- The NOrth Face ultra running shoes (cushioning helped)
- Train according to MAF (even though the MAF HR was 10 too high)
- Increase PVC magnesium intake on daily basis (2 x 2 pills)
- Friday training (basically half ironman)

## what to do for the next race?
test fat oxidation (grams)
bike fitting
power meter (garmin vector s3)
new tri-suit 
new wetsuit? (zone3 aspire?)
swim recovery (elbow high)



## What did I eat during race day

breakfast:
- coffee with cream and mct oil                           (        )
- scrambeld eggs and bacon bits                           (        )
- oatmeal with milk and ucan (1 package (22 grams))       ( 80 kcal)

at the swim start:
- maurten 100 gel                                         (100 kcal)

after swim:
- maurten 100 gel                                         (100 kcal)

on the bike:
- 1.5 litres of hydrate (6 tablets on 2.5 litres)         (  0 kcal)
- 4 maurten gels                                          (400 kcal)
- 600ml of maurten 320 mix                                (400 kcal)
- 2 or 3 half bananas                                     (300 kcal)  ??

after bike:
- 450 - 500 ml of maurten 320 mix                         (350 kcal)
- natural energy bar                                      ( 90 kcal)

during the run:
- 2 or 3 (half) bananas                                   (300 kcal)
- 3 cups of cola                                          (300 ml = 300 kcal) ??
- cup of water at almost every aid station                
- 2 ultra salts at 25-26KM
                                                          2000 kcal ??  During the race of carbohydrates
                                                          

## Why did the swim not go according to plan?



## Bike improved but could be better

It was all about not using the aero position. Using aero during the last 30KM give me a 8+% improvement. So that could have been 20-40 minutes faster. The wind increased for the second loop, so that is where most of the benefit would have been. Training was good but Wattage should be increased and HR should be lower during training.

## Run was "great" after bike and not expected!

With the way I felt at the end of the bike (hamstring right leg acting up), and the beginning of the run I could still feel the 
hamstring. So the goal was to run 6 min/km pace with a HR of 140-150. But I could manage faster than 5:45 pace. So I expected to crash and burn later on in the marathon. But it never happened. Controlled my pace and listened to the body. Used the arms (running form) and pushed my shoulders back. That really helped and I could contine. It also helped that most of training was on that pace so the body got used to it. So training should be on a lower HR (125) and increased pace (5:45/km). Running daily for an hour really helped a lot (even when I was tired and really). This is really the MAF training and trying to look after my running form (moving the arms up and back, pushing the shoulders back). I believe that this really helped me a lot, by focusing on the arms and shoulders instead of the hurting legs :-) During the run I walked up to a hill to make sure that I didn't blow up. I also walked at most aid stations to drink water. So this could have been a sub 4 hours marathon :-). But I am still very happy about this performance

## HR was too high during swimming and stayed relatively high

My swim didn't go as planned. Not sure yet why:
- was it too much breakfast (played a role for sure)
- wetsuit too tight (may be because of breakfast :-) 
- wetsuit not correctly on 
- should practice on 2 beat kick
- or aim for a 1:15 swim with lower heartrate
