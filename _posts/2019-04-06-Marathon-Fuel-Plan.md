# The Plan
The idea is to run the Rotterdam Marathon without a large amount of carb. Most the training that I have done was fasted (if the running was in the morning) and with some carbs if it was in the afternoon/evening.
The goal is to run the marathon:
- without stopping
- without carb loading (no pasta party for me :-))
- using [Generation UCAN](https://www.generationucan.com/)
- using [Ultra Salt](http://www.purevitaminclub.com) (before and during)  
- using ["Sport Rusten 100 dagen"](https://www.sportrusten.nl/sportrusten-schema-voor-de-marathon/) training
- using ["Sport Rusten breathing"](https://www.sportrusten.nl/kennisbank/test-zelf-je-ademhaling/)
- with a pace of 5:12.00 per kilometer (or [08:22.00 mile](http://www.bane.info))
- with only drinking water
- while wearing the [The North Face Ultra Cardiac II Trail Shoes](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/mens-ultra-cardiac-ii-nf0a2vuv?variationId=WU5#hero=0)
- while wearing the [HUUB ACTIVE SOCK - WHITE](https://huubdesign.com/products/huub-active-sock-white)
- while wearing the [huub-core-triathlon-suit](https://huubdesign.com/collections/triathlon-suits/products/huub-core-triathlon-suit-sleeved-mens-black-red?variant=22380811783)
- using the [garmin fenix 5](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552982/pn/010-01688-00)
- using the [garmin hrm-tri](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/pn/010-10997-09)
- using the [salomon fueling belt](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/agile-500-belt-set.html#1191=9594)
