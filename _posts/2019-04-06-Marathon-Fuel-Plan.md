# The Plan
The idea is to run the Rotterdam Marathon without a large amount of carb. Most the training that I have done was fasted (if the running was in the morning) and with some carbs if it was in the afternoon/evening.
The goal is to run the marathon:
- without stopping
- without carb loading (no pasta party for me :-))
- using UCANN
- using [Ultra Salt](http://www.purevitaminclub.com) (before and during)  
- using "Sport Rusten 14K schema" 
- with a pace of 5:12.00 per kilometer (or [08:26.00 mile](http://www.bane.info))
- with only drinking water
- while wearing the The North Face
