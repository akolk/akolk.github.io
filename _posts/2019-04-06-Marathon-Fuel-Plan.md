# The Plan
The idea is to run the Rotterdam Marathon without a large amount of carb. Most the training that I have done was fasted (if the running was in the morning) and with some carbs if it was in the afternoon/evening.
The goal is to run the marathon:
- [ ] without stopping
- [ ] without carb loading (no pasta party for me :-))
- [ ] using [Generation UCAN](https://www.generationucan.com/)
- [ ] using [Ultra Salt](http://www.purevitaminclub.com) (before and during)  
- [ ] using ["Sport Rusten 100 dagen"](https://www.sportrusten.nl/sportrusten-schema-voor-de-marathon/) training
- [ ] using ["Sport Rusten breathing"](https://www.sportrusten.nl/kennisbank/test-zelf-je-ademhaling/)
- [ ] with a pace of 5:12.00 per kilometer (or [08:22.00 mile](http://www.bane.info))
- [ ] with only drinking water
- [ ] while wearing the [The North Face Ultra Cardiac II Trail Shoes](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/mens-ultra-cardiac-ii-nf0a2vuv?variationId=WU5#hero=0)
- [ ] while wearing the [HUUB ACTIVE SOCK - WHITE](https://huubdesign.com/products/huub-active-sock-white)
- [ ] while wearing the [huub-core-triathlon-suit](https://huubdesign.com/collections/triathlon-suits/products/huub-core-triathlon-suit-sleeved-mens-black-red?variant=22380811783)
- [ ] using the [garmin fenix 5](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552982/pn/010-01688-00)
- [ ] using the [garmin hrm-tri](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/pn/010-10997-09)
- [ ] using the [salomon fueling belt](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/agile-500-belt-set.html#1191=9594)
- [ ] using  [Project Rudy Rydon sun glasses](https://www.rudyproject.com/ww/en/products/performance-eyewear/rydon.html)
- [ ] using [arm extentions from columbia](https://www.columbia.com/freezer-zero-arm-sleeves-SU9090.html?cgid=activity-trailrunning-accessories#start=1)
- [ ] using OOFOS slippers


# Challenges
There are a couple of challenges that need to be met:
- the weather will be warm so be prepared for that (electrolyes, sun protection, cap)
- arriving on time in Rotterdam, the start is from 10:00 but the trains don't run at that time
- starting from wave 4 so need to overtake a lot of people :-)
- dropping the bag of in time
- 

# Training
I started preparing for the Rotterdam Marathon on December 28th 2018, exactly 100 days before April 7th, 2019. And used the 100 days training plan from "Sport Rusten". This plan calls for 4 training days a week: 1 at slow pace, 2 at marathon pace and 1 at high intensity. Because of other training (swimming and biking) I dropped the slow pace and let the marathon pace be mostly controlled by my heart rate (150-160bpm) and the high intensity pace by the range of 160bpm-170bpm. The goal was to become faster (better pace) overtime while training in the heartrate range. That worked, but I also noticed that taking the Broadspectrum magnesium vitamin pill (twice a day) will help to reduce blood pressure and the heartrate (take one in the morning and one before sleep).

While training I also measured by ketones and found them to be in the range of 0.3 to 4.3 mmol, so withing Natural Ketosis range. 

# Lessons Learned

- "Be patient and follow your heart rate" (don't train to hard all time, 70-80 percent should be slow)
- Consistency is the most important thing (doing a training is more important than training hard all the time)
