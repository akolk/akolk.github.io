My sessions are all on either two surfaces - artificial turf or grass. One of the main advantages to these two surfaces is they magnify the noise of the athletes foot strike and toe off, especially when wet. 
This helps greatly in identifying issues and problems with athletes running gait and foot contacts. I would implore all runners next time they are running on a 'loose' or wet surface, to listen to their feet and their ground contact!! Things to listen for are the length of the noise - is one foot on the ground LONGER than the other? 
Also listen for one noise being LOUDER than the other - are you transferring your weight unevenly. Is one leg doing more work than the other.

Listen to the type of noise - does your non-dominant leg make a pulling/scaping noise? Does it make a noise consistent with twisting? Does it make a double noise - your heel hitting the ground and then the front of your foot on each contact?

I'm sure a number of you are thinking right now, 'of all the times I've run, and I've heard my feet, I have never really listened or examined the noise of them!' It is often suggested, 'runners wishing to reduce the forces going through their joints may be able to achieve this simply by reducing the sound of their foot strike', you should be very aware the noises are rarely caused by the feet alone, so trying to just reduce noise could actually move you closer to injury! This method of gait retraining is very traditional but only focuses on the “outcome” of the movement rather than the stimulus causing the movement, and therefore the noise. 

## Hip Rotation
Like most things related to physical training, the proper degree of hip (pelvic) rotation exists on a bell curve. Meaning, too little or too much hip rotation is considered inefficient.
Due to counter rotation of the spine, the hips and torso (shoulders) rotate in opposite directions. While not always the case, the degree of rotation of the shoulders often results in the hips rotating to the same degree. Therefore by focusing on rotating the shoulders more in the transverse plane, this can often result in greater hip rotation.
Conversely, by focusing on pushing back with the drive leg(s) and extending the leg behind the body, this will often cue the hips to rotate.
It is likely that when learning how to rotate the hips, an individual will over rotate the hips. This is normal and expected. Initially, the most important thing to learn is how to cue the hips to rotate. Once they learn how to rotate the hips via counter-rotation of the spine, they can optimize the degree of rotation for their ideal running stride.


To visualize spinal rotation, think about grabbing a vertical metal coil with both hands and twisting the coil in opposite directions. When released, the coil will spring back to the original position. As you can see, releasing the spring creates energy that is used to rotate the hips that in turn, propels the runner forward.
Coupled motion pertains to how and where power is initiated – in other words, the chain of events that causes a runner to propel themselves forward. Regarding hip rotation, the following is the proper sequence:
1. Spine counter rotates
2. Spine springs back and counter-rotates in opposing direction.
3. Hips (pelvis) rotate in the transverse plane
4. Hip extension (leg extends behind the hips)
5. Foot pushes off the ground
